1.In LC-3, what is the benefit of using a subroutine? (5 points)
Using a subroutine allows you to implement a specific set of code multiple times without having to write it repeatedly.
This is useful for a function that you might want to run multiple times but with different values.




2.Explain what is a stack underflow. (5 points)
Stack underflow is when the stack data structure is empty. If the stack is popped and the stack top address tries to go lower
